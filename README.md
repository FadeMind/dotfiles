# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfile/configurations, geared mostly towards a macOS-based web development environment. Forking or just implementing the configs here might end up breaking your stuff, but feel free to use whatever appeals to you. I've tried to credit any inspirations for these files, but over a few years of constant tweaking I'm sure some sources have been lost along the way.

Happy hacking!
